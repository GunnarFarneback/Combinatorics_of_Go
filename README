This repository contains code developed as part of the research on the
number of legal positions in the game of go together with John Tromp
in 2005. 

Documentation of the results, including the published paper
'Combinatorics of Go', can be found on Tromp's page at
http://tromp.github.io/go/legal.html 

In addition to computing the number of legal positions, here can also
be found code for
* estimating max number of games (included in 'Combinatorics of Go')
* computing max number of liberties of a single string (unpublished)
* computing max number of strings (unpublished)
* computing max number of neighbor strings of a single string (unpublished)
* computing max number of pseudoliberties of a single string (unpublished)

All this code is provided as is with no guarantees of any kind. It has
been more than 10 years since it was written.
